Superpower is a fast-paced story that’s informative yet not too information-heavy. This book is definitely accessible to all readers and assumes no prior knowledge. Gold manages to break down complex development tasks into easy-to-understand descriptions of the problems faced when revolutionizing one of America’s biggest pieces of infrastructure. Furthermore, Superpower does a great job of focusing on the most captivating stories and keeping the book moving forward at a steady pace.

As the US and the rest of the world begin to move towards more renewable sources of energy, entrepreneurs are scrambling to take their part in the revolution. Michael Skelly is one such person who is bent on updating the mess of loosely connected wires that is the American electrical grid. Superpower follows Skelly’s career as he takes on projects on the cutting edge of energy innovation including a wind farm and an interstate high-voltage transmission line.

In the US, the grid arose in a haphazard manner as the country rushed to electrify. What’s left behind is a collection of grid operators and utility companies who each operate in their own political and economical interests with little incentive to cooperate with each other or innovate new technologies to benefit the consumer. As the book explores, even companies with ample funding and solid development plans are faced with the struggles of local politics, NIMBYs, and the glacial pace of the federal government. Even with a seemingly win-win project, it becomes clear that the task of getting states to cooperate with each other and convincing people of progress is near impossible. Unlike the interstate highway system, the power grid is almost invisible and it’s incredibly difficult to get people to support something when they can’t see the tangible benefits.

Gold ends the book by highlighting a paper written by Christopher Clack detailing how, by 2030, the US could cut carbon dioxide emissions rates by 80% with only existing technology. There’s no need for us to wait for some sort of breakthrough in electrical storage; the technology is already here we just need to figure out how to get states to cooperate with each other. We need more stories like Michael Skully’s in which persistent and dedicated people slowly fix the broken system. Overall, I think Superpower contains a lot of interesting knowledge about renewable energy but also gives an interesting look into human nature and politics.
